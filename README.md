# 📚 Book Genre Classification using Metadata

This project focuses on predicting the genre of books using basic metadata like author popularity, book length, and number of keywords. Instead of analyzing full text, we rely on lightweight features to train a machine learning model for genre classification.

## 🚀 Features

- Cleans and preprocesses metadata
- Combines features using TF-IDF vectorization
- Trains a Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluates performance using standard classification metrics
- Includes basic visualizations for data understanding

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning** – Handles missing values and prepares data
2. **Feature Engineering** – Combines metadata into a text feature
3. **Vectorization** – Applies TF-IDF to convert text to numerical vectors
4. **Label Encoding** – Converts genres into numeric labels
5. **Modeling** – Trains a Random Forest Classifier
6. **Evaluation** – Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
